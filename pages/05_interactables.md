# 05 - Interactables (and other Mechanics)
Interactables contain many different non-essential, but fun mechanics you can add to your map. They can be found inside the map kit, most of them under `Special > Interactables`, and can be inserted using the Mapmaking Companion plugin (recommended).

# Walljumps
Walljumps are parts you can latch onto and jump off of. To create a walljump from scratch, assign any part a `_action` string attribute and set it to `WallJump`, though it's a good idea to take one from the kit or insert using the TRIA plugin, since those come with the default walljump texture placed on the part's front face. 

You can add a `Timeout` number attribute to set the amount of seconds a player can stay on the walljump before falling off.

By default, players can latch onto any face of a WallJump part. You can change it to front face only by adding a `UseFrontOnly` boolean attribute. This is generally good practice, as it prevents (quite literal) edge cases from occuring.

# Wallruns
Wallruns (`_action` attribute set to `WallRun`) are essentially walljumps with an added movement mechanic, where attached players move along the part in the direction indicated by the beam. The wallruns included in the kit/plugin come with a `Speed` attribute using `studs/second`. 

You can resize the wallrun as you like, though you may need to manually adjust the width of the beam by going into the Beam's properties and changing properties `Width0` and `Width1`. 

By connecting wallrun pieces together, you can create curved or even upside-down wallruns!

## Momentum Wallruns
Momentum wallruns make it so you retain a certain amount of speed from the wallrun after you jump off by adding a `Momentum` number attribute, where `Wallrun Speed * Momentum` gives you how much speed a player will inherit. With a high momentum value, you can easily send players flying, no matter how fast the actual wallrun is, which can make for some fun behavior.

Normal wallruns and momentum wallruns are color coded in the map kit, and Iâ€™d recommend you do this too if you plan on using both of them in the same map, for example by changing the color as seen in the map kit.

# Ziplines
> Ziplines are found under `Special > Ziplines` rather than `Special > Interactables`.

Ziplines allow for quick traversal across a level and can even be used for interesting gameplay. 

Each zipline model contains nodes which are used to generate a Bezier curve, along with a `Customization` configuration containing the following attributes:

- AllowLeaning `bool`
    - Used to toggle zipline leaning
- Color `Color3`
    - Changes zipline color
    - You can also insert a `UIGradient` under `Customization` to change the zipline's color into a gradient.
- Jumpable `bool`
    - Toggles jumping off a zipline
    - If `AllowLeaning` is also enabled, player gets a boost in the direction they're leaning towards when they jump.
- Material `string`
    - Changes zipline material
- Sparkle `bool`
    - Toggles spark particle FX when riding the zipline
- Speed `number`
    - Speed of zipline in studs/second
- Width `number`
    - Thickness of zipline in studs

# Rails
> Ziplines are found under `Special > Rails` rather than `Special > Interactables`.

They're basically ziplines but you ride on top of them.

# Boosts
Speedboosts, jumpboosts, and Gravity are non-collideable parts that change the player's walkspeed (20 by default), jump power (50 by default), and gravity (280 by default) respectively. Despite being called boosts, they can either raise or lower these values. They contain the following attributes:

- _action `string`
    - set to `WalkSpeed`, `JumpPower`, or `Gravity`
- EasingStyle `string`
    - lets you tween between old and new movement values
- TweenDuration `number`
    - how long the tween takes
- WalkSpeed/JumpPower/Gravity `number`
    - self explanatory

# Killbricks
- _action `string`
    - set to `Kill`

Killbricks kill you. Players die if they are killed. Thatâ€™s the way it should be.

# Orbs
Mechanically similar, somewhat, to walljumps, players are able to jump inside of Orbs and launch themselves great distances. There are two types of Orbs: **launch Orbs**, which launch players in a set direction, and **pivot Orbs**, which let players choose their launch trajectory by turning their character.

Each Orb model contains a Hitbox mesh, and most notably, Orbs can be resized as small or as large as needed. They share the following attributes:

- Power `number`
    - Affects how powerful the launch is; somewhat analogous to jump power
- Timeout `number`
    - How long a player can stay inside an orb before falling out
- Type `string`
    - set to `Launch` or `Pivot`- you probably won't be changing this at all

# Teleporters
When a player touches the blue `Teleporter` part, theyâ€™ll teleport to the orange `Destination` part found under `Teleporter > Destination`. 

The teleporter part has an attribute `SetCameraFront` that when enabled, the player will face where the front side of the `Destination` part is pointing, which is marked by the green SurfaceGui, after they teleport.

# Jetstreams
These enable underwater currents, running from the Back to the Front face of the `Jetstream` part. They contain the following attributes:

- _action `string`
    - set to `Jetstream`
- Falloff `bool`
    - toggles falloff in power of the jetstream as you move further away from the jetstream source
- Power `number`
    - self explanatory

# Skill Cancels
These parts allow you to force players off wallruns and ziplines as shown in the map kit.

- _action `string`
    - `Cancel`

# Bounce Pads

- _action `string`
    - `BouncePad`
- Power `number`

# Variants
Using the map kit as an example, TRIA.os will choose between one of the three color coded variants to load, each of which are located in their own folder under `Special > Variant`.
