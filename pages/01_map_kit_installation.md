# 01 - Getting the Map Kit

The official TRIA.os Map Kit comes as a Roblox model containing the proper structure needed to work inside the TRIA.os game. It is generally recommended you start with this when creating a new map.

To get the map kit, you can either [purchase the map kit (for free)](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/93671903447129/TRIAos-Map-Making-Kit) or by inserting it via the TRIA Mapmaking Companion plugin, [which can be installed here.](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/13782566472/TRIAos-Mapmaking-Companion)

# Via the TRIA Plugin

While the Mapmaking Companion isn't strictly necessary to create a functioning map, it provides many useful tools almost every step of the way.

After installing the plugin, open it in Roblox Studio and insert the Map Kit from the ðŸ§©Resources tab. You can then select the model and open it in the plugin by clicking at the bottom of the panel where it says `No map selected (Click to select)`
