# Getting the Map Kit

The official TRIA.os Map Kit comes as a Roblox model containing the proper structure needed to work inside the TRIA.os game. It is generally recommended you start with this when creating a new map.

To get the map kit, you can either [get it directly](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/93671903447129/TRIAos-Map-Making-Kit) or by inserting it via the [TRIA Mapmaking Companion](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/13782566472/TRIAos-Mapmaking-Companion) plugin.
