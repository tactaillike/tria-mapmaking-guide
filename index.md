The [TRIA.os Map Kit Compendium](https://github.com/tactaillike/tria-mapmaking-guide), created by tac_taillike, is a community resource containing all the information needed to create a map for TRIA.os, a fast-paced parkour obby game on the Roblox platform. 

It provides an overview of the official TRIA.os map kit and its contents, along with the basic steps for whitelisting and publishing the map to TRIA.os via the in-game Map Manager.

> ⚠️ This compendium is work-in-progress and may contain errors. As such, the contents are subject to change and Tac is not liable for any broken maps. The most up to date information will be found in the official TRIA.os documentation linked below.
